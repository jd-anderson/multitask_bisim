# Bisimulation-Based Analysis of Policy Gradient Performance in Multitask Linear Quadratic Control

This repository includes the Python codes to implement the experimental results of the following paper:

1) C. Stamouli*, L. F. Toso*, A. Tsiamis, J. Anderson, G. Pappas (2025). [Bisimulation-Based Analysis of Policy Gradient Performance in Multitask Linear Quadratic Control]()

^* = equal contribution.
  
## Instructions

To run the codes in this repository, you only need a working Jupyter installation.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any trouble running those codes or have any question about the paper, please email [Charis Stamouli](stamouli@seas.upenn.edu) and [Leonardo F. Toso](mailto:lt2879@columbia.edu).
